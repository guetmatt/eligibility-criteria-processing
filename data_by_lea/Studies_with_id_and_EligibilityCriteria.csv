NCT04604548,"Inclusion Criteria:

1. Males and females aged 18 years or older at screening.
2. Ability and willingness to provide written Informed Consent prior to screening evaluations.
3. Having fulfilled all inclusion and exclusion criteria and completed the full treatment period of study KH176-202.
4. Disease appropriate physical and mental health as established at Screening by medical history, physical examination, ECG and vital signs recording, and results of clinical chemistry and haematology testing as judged by the investigator.
5. Objectified Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≥45% (echocardiography, or otherwise).
6. Left Ventricular (LV) wall thickness ≤15 mm.
7. Left atrium dilatation ≤ 40 mL/m2. Note: No need to test LV parameters (criteria #5, #6, #7) if favourable echocardiography (or otherwise) results dated less than 13 months prior to Screening are available.
8. Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use highly effective contraceptive methods during the entire study, i.e., combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) oral, intravaginal or transdermal hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation;, oral, injectable or implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; use of an intrauterine device; an intrauterine hormone releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion and vasectomy of the partner. Any hormonal contraception method must be supplemented with a barrier method (preferably male condom). Vasectomised partner is considered a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the subject and that the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success. Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. Reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

   Note 1: Natural family planning methods, female condom, cervical cap or diaphragm are not considered adequate contraceptive methods in the context of this study.

   Note 2: To be considered not of childbearing potential, potential female subjects must be post-menopausal for at least two years, or have been surgically sterilised (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) for at least 6 months prior to Screening.

   Note 3: KH176 has been shown non-genotoxic judged from the Ames test, Chromosomal Aberration test and in vivo Micronucleus test. Moreover, appreciable systemic exposure from the exposure to (\~2.5 mL) semen is extremely unlikely. However, until reproductive toxicology studies have confirmed that KH176 does not adversely affect normal reproduction in adult males and females, as well as causing developmental toxicity in the offspring, the following contraceptive precautions must be adhered to:
   * male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use condoms during the entire study.
   * female partners of childbearing potential of male subjects must be willing to use adequate contraceptive methods during the entire study, i.e., a hormonal contraceptive method (pill, vaginal ring, patch, implant, injectable, hormone-medicated intrauterine device) or an intrauterine device.

Angiographic Inclusion Criteria:

Treatment of up to three de novo lesions in a maximum of two epicardial vessels, with a maximum of two lesions per epicardial vessel. If only a single lesion is to be treated, it must be a target lesion. Up to one non-target lesion can be treated. Non-target lesion treatment can occur only in a non-target vessel.

If there are two target lesions within the same epicardial vessel, the two target lesions must be at least 15 mm apart per visual estimation; otherwise this is considered as a single target lesion for lesion (and stent) length determination and must be treated with a single study device.

1. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated or quantitatively assessed %DS of ≥50% and \< 100%, with a thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow of ≥ 1, and one of the following: stenosis ≥ 70%, an abnormal functional test (e.g., fractional flow reserve ≤0.80 AND/OR a positive stress test), or presentation with an acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or NSTEMI within 2 weeks of index procedure, or STEMI \>72 hours but ≤ 2 weeks prior to the index procedure).

1. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with reference vessel diameter (RVD) by visual estimation of ≥ 2.50 mm and ≤ 3.75 mm.
2. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with length by visual estimation of ≤ 24 mm.

Note: Subjects with Unstable angina (UA) or NSTEMI or STEMI occurring \> 2 weeks of the index procedure can be included in the trial but should be categorized based on their current angina class.

Note: To exclude enrollment of excessively small vessels, if the operator believes that based on visual angiographic assessments, the distal reference vessel diameter is ≤ 2.75 mm such that the plan is to implant a 2.5 mm device (stent or scaffold) in a target lesion, it is strongly recommended that either on-line QCA or intravascular imaging (ultrasound or optical coherence tomography) is used and demonstrates that the measured distal RVD for this target lesion is ≥ 2.50 mm (by at least one of these imaging modalities). This measurement may be performed before or after pre-dilatation, but before randomization. If the distal RVD measures \<2.5 mm, that lesion IS NOT ELIGIBLE for randomization. Such a lesion may be treated as a non-target lesion.

For subjects presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), LVEF must be assessed within 1 week of the index procedure and after ACS presentation, which may include contrast left ventriculography during the index procedure but prior to randomization in order to confirm the subject's eligibility.
7. Subject has undergone prior PCI within the target vessel during the last 12 months. Prior PCI within the non-target vessel or any peripheral intervention is acceptable if performed anytime \>30 days before the index procedure, or between a minimum of 24 hours and 30 days before the index procedure if successful and uncomplicated.

* Subject lives with (or has substantial periods of contact with) a regular caregiver who is willing to attend all visits, oversee the subject's compliance with protocol-specified procedures and study medication, and report on subject's status.

Note: A non-cohabiting caregiver must spend sufficient time with the subject so that, in the opinion of the Investigator, the caregiver can reliably assess cognitive function, activities and behavior, and report on the subject's compliance and health. As caregiver time spent with a potential subject is anticipated to be highly variable across countries and cultures, GSK will consider a variety of different measures by which this stipulation may be met, and GSK should be consulted if adequacy of a caregiver situation is in doubt. However, as guidance, the ability for a caregiver to meet his/her expected responsibilities for this study would normally be possible when the caregiver spends no less than 10 hours per week with the subject, divided over multiple days.)

* Subject has provided full written informed consent prior to the performance of any protocol-specified procedure; or if unable to provide informed consent due to cognitive status, full written informed consent on behalf of the subject has been provided by a legally acceptable representative.

(Note: If not currently treated, but active depression is suspected, the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) can be used by the Investigator as a guide for deciding whether a prospective subject requires treatment. If the subject has a CSDD score \>7, the Investigator should decide if the subject has depression in need of prescribed medication, and a CSDD \>12 is considered a strong indicator that treatment is needed.
